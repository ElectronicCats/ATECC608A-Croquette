PCB files for the Electronic Cats Croquette ATECC608. 

Format is KiCAD schematic and board layout

## Description

The ATECC608 is the latest crypto-auth chip from Microchip, and it uses I2C to send/receive commands. Once you 'lock' the chip with your details, you can use it for ECDH and AES-128 encrypt/decrypt/signing. There's also hardware support for random number generation, and SHA-256/HMAC hash functions to  greatly speed up a slower micro's cryptography commands.

### Features:
- Cryptographic co-processor with secure hardware-based key storage
- Protected storage for up to 16 Keys, certificates or data
- ECDH: FIPS SP800-56A Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
- NIST standard P256 elliptic curve support
- SHA-256 & HMAC hash including off-chip context save/restore
- AES-128: encrypt/decrypt, galois field multiply for GCM
